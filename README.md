# ML notebooks
A collection of notebooks that I'm starting

To get started, let's setup the environment (everything has been done my Macbook Pro)

Many of the ideas, text, and code are mine. However, I have used ChatGPT to also generate ideas, code, and text. ChatGPT often provides insights that I didn't think of or different ways of explaining things. Overall, my goal is not to write a tutorial using only my own ideas, thoughts, and code, but rather to write something that is useful for understanding how deep learning at an intuitive level. There will be terms which are thrown out which probably won't make much sense in the beginning. I hope to explain them in time.

Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start Jupyter Labs
```bash
jupyter lab
```

Deactivate
```bash
deactivate
```

# ml-notebooks

- [Introduction](000-Introduction.ipynb) - building a neural network to do addition of two digits
- [Exploring the Adder Model Part 1](001-ExploringAdderModelPart1.ipynb) - Introduces an intuition for why addition can work and hyperparameter search
  

### Extras
- [Concepts](Concepts.ipynb) - a place where concepts are maintained that are important to machine learning
